# Game Programming Project 25

This document explains how to configure, build, and run the project using CMake on Windows.

---

## Prerequisites

* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
* Compatible compiler / build system (e.g., Visual Studio)

---

## Project Structure

```
game-programming/
├── src/            # Source code
├── include/        # Header files
├── assets/         # Game assets (copy to build directory)
├── CMakeLists.txt  # CMake configuration
└── build/          # Build directory (generated by CMake)
```

---

## Build Instructions

### 1. Configure the project

From the project root, run:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
```

> This generates the build files and `CMakeCache.txt` inside the `build` folder.

### 2. Build the project

```bash
cmake --build build --config Debug --target ALL_BUILD -j 12
```

> The compiled executable will be located in:

```
build/Debug/
```

### 3. Place assets

After building, copy the `assets` folder to the build output:

```
game-programming/build/Debug/assets/
```

> The game expects assets to be in this directory at runtime.

## Notes

* If you get the error:

```
Error: not a CMake build directory (missing CMakeCache.txt)
```

it means you forgot to run the configure step (`cmake -S . -B build`) first.

* Do not delete the `build/` folder unless you want to reconfigure everything.

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Debug --target ALL_BUILD -j 12
```

Copy `assets/` into:

```
build/Debug/assets/
```
